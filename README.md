### This is Not Licensed Code
There's nothing here outside a demonstration of my competency (such that it is) with something that interested me for like, 5 seconds.

I knew next to nothing about SQLModel, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, or FastAPI. Now I can do something useful with it.

This repo will just do random, possibly dumb, borderline-3headed things with whatever data polygon.io is willing to spit out. I'm just learning a thing for the sake of knowing it.
